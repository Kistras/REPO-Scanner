## What does it do
You press a button (F by default), nearby valuable items are discovered (and shown on screen). Already discovered items are shown a second time.

Items discovered initially will appear on your minimap as usual. Even for your friends, should you be playing multiplayer.

Has a cooldown of 10 seconds, tracked on the top of the screen. Said bar shouldn't appear by itself unless scanner is used.

## Configuring
Use your modinstaller (or BepInEx's config).
- Keybind for scanning can be changed (f by default)
- Scan radius can be changed (10 by default)
- Cooldown can be changed (10 by default)

## Why scan GUI ugly and not in the style of the game
Because I can't figure out how to make it render properly.
